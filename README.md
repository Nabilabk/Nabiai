# 🎭 Acting AI — When Your Face Becomes the Controller

**Acting AI** is an innovative AI-powered game that turns **facial expressions into gameplay mechanics**.  
By combining **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **game design**, the project creates a unique interactive experience where players progress by accurately expressing emotions in front of a webcam.

This project sits at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, gaming, and human emotional expression**.

## 🎮 Game Modes

### 🧪 Training Mode
A safe, pressure-free environment to improve your skills:
- Unlimited practice time
- Learn and master each emotion
- Real-time feedback from the AI
- Ideal preparation for Solo and Multiplayer modes

---

### 🧠 Solo Mode
A progressive challenge mode:
- Increasing difficulty levels
- Score-based objectives
- Time and precision management
- Improve emotional control and consistency

---

### 🎮 Multiplayer Mode
A competitive **turn-based emotion duel**:
- Choose who starts (manual or random)
- Players reproduce sequences of emotions
- Correct emotion → keep playing
- Mistake → turn passes to the opponent
- 4 increasing difficulty levels
- First player to complete all levels wins

A mix of **strategy, concentration, and emotional control**.

## 🌍 Project Vision

Acting AI is more than a game:
- 🎓 A **learning tool** for acting and emotional expression
- 🪞 A **digital mirror** helping users understand their own emotions
- 🤖 A **human-centered AI demonstration**

The project shows how artificial intelligence can **enhance human expression rather than replace it**, opening new ways for interaction between humans and machines.
